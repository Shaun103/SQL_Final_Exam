This is the final project that I created for
a CIS_4301_Database_Theory_and_Practices that I took in the Fall 2021

I saved the raw SQL code in a .txt file so that it can be referenced 
in the future. the .txt showcases SQL code to create, insert, select 
items within the database

The project also required that the creation of indexs, functions 
as well as functions that return specified data

The last sections of the .txt file showcases how to use the different
functions once they are created

The .mdf file is the product of running all of the selected 
SQL code within a Microsoft SQL database
